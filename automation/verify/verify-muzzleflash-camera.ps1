# Muzzle-flash camera-alignment capture: for a given demo tick, capture the spectated
# player's muzzle flash in BOTH first person and third person, for one or more EFFECTS
# weaponfx packs (Povarehok "on" vs "modern"). Purpose: prove whether a pack's flash
# renders on the WORLD weapon when the camera detaches (third person / free cam), the way
# Povarehok's world-space flash does -- vs a viewmodel-only flash that only shows in first
# person and floats when the view leaves the eye.
#
# WHY the two camera modes use different seek techniques:
#   First person (in-eye): the engine spawns only the _fps VIEWMODEL muzzle system for the
#     spectated player. A forward micro-seek (preload tick -> target tick) replays the
#     weapon_fire packet and lands EXACTLY on the target tick with the flash alive. Cold and
#     cheap.
#   Third person: the world (non-_fps) muzzle system only spawns while the spec_mode-3 chase
#     is active, and spec_mode does NOT apply while the demo is paused (Filmmaker.cpp). So TP
#     must PLAY through the fire tick in chase, then pause at/just past the target tick.
#
# Lands first person exactly on -Tick; lands third person on the first tick >= -Tick (a
# muzzle flash particle lingers a few ticks at 0.1x, so a 1-2 tick overshoot still shows it).
#
# Output: automation/runs/muzzleflash-cam/<timestamp>/<pack>-<fp|tp>-t<tick>.png + a
# capture-log.txt. Screenshots are the deliverable -- eyeball fp-vs-tp per pack.
